# SciFi UI Project

# Description of the assignment
The objective of this assignmment was to make a
UI that had a Science Fiction setting. I decided
to base my UI off being in a cockpit of a mech
aka a giant pilotable giant robot.

The view that the user has is from inside the mech.
The user has to prevent the mech from losing HP
from the enemies as they try to get to the edge
of the screen.

The user does this by using one of the 3 available
weapons to shot the enemy.

There is also a radar to show a smaller view of where
the enemies are and also a Status Diplay to show the
user how much HP the mech has left.

# Instructions
The main controls for the assignment are:

- The mouse

For aiming the reticle and when the user clicks the
mouse it will shoot a laser towards the center of the
reticle to shot the enemy.

It is also used to click on buttons which are
located at the bottom of the screen to select a weapon.
The weapon determines where the laser will come from and
 then join to where the mouse is pointing to at that current moment

- The 'a' key

While the user holds down the A key they are able to
see the status of the mech.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
